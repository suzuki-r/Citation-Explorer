# Citation-Explorer
Python file to calculate a cumulative citation numbers using InspireHEP API.

## Usage
Launch jupyter notebook, change the author_id as you like. The output file will be generated.

## Possible issues
I assumed the largest number of citations is 250 per paper (controlled by get_citing_dates(recid)/params/size).
